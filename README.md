# heat_transfer
Some numerical solutions to heat transfer problems for IEK212/3 heat transfer and its application course.
One of the first simple example is the unsteady-state one-dimensional heat conduction equation (Fourier equation).

I will continue to build this repository with more useful examples when I have time.
